        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Led a team of six undergraduates in developing an innovative American Sign Language (ASL) translation app 
          as part of the EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service) program. This project aimed to bridge 
          communication gaps and improve accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community through 
          technology-driven solutions.
